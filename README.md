  Oida is Oda's internal linter that enforces code style and modularization in
  our Django projects.

## Usage

    oida <path>


## Concepts

Oida expects the code to be structured with a project as the top package and
then apps as submodules below this. Sub-services are a group of apps that are
freely allowed to import from each other. Sub-services are defined in a
`confservices.py` file.

Here's an example project structure:

    project/
        __init__.py
        confservice.py
        first_app/
            __init__.py
            ...
        second_app/
            __init__.py
            ....
        third_app/
            __init__.py
            ...
        ...

and here's an example sub-services config:

    SUBSERVICES = {
        "first_and_second": {
            "apps": ["project.first_app", "project.second_app"],
        }
        "third": {
            "apps": ["project.third_app"],
            "database": "other_db",  # This sub-service has it's own database
        }
    }


## Checks

 * **Apps:** This check validates that no imports are done across sub-modules.
 * **Config:** This check validates sub-services configs found in
   confservice.py files.
 * **Imports:**: This module checks that relative imports to not cross app
   boundaries.
